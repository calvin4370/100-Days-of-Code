Absolute File Path
------------------
- Always starts from the root directory, C: in Windows, Macintosh HD on Mac, for example

e.g. this file's absolute path is C:\Users\Calvi\Desktop\100-Days-of-Code\Intemediate\Day 24 - Files, Directories and Paths\file_paths.txt

When writing python code, the root folder is just /, no need to write C:/


Relative File Path
------------------
- starts from the working directory

./ means the working directory
you could shorten it by missing out the ./ also

../ refers to the parent folder of the working directory you are currently in
